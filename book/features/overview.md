# TeachBooks Authoring Features

As TeachBooks, we collect a suite of existing open-source software and keep our books up-to-date so you don't have to! Some of the software is developed with our TA's to improve the learning experience of our students and ease the book-development process for our teachers. By deploying these tools from a central location we can prevent common problems before they arise, and fix them quickly when they do occur. As the open-source software landscape changes rapidly, it is essential to keep in contact and share resources amongst ourselves to minimize maintenance and downtime for our book websites and focus on what really matters: teaching!

This chapter provides a list of commonly used book features together with sub-pages that provide additional information on:
- the purpose
- how to install them
- how to use them
- where to find the source code

To see examples for these features, go to the [Examples chapter](../examples/overview.md).
