# GitHub Desktop

By now you should have an idea on the purpose of git and GitLab. GitHub is a competitor company to GitLab. It provides very similar services, but they are often called different names, or have slightly different features. GitHub provides a free software that is very useful: GitHub Desktop! 

While GitLab is a cloud-based version control system built around git, GitHub Desktop makes it possible to manage our git repositories locally on our computers, even though they are stored on GitLab. this is very useful for working with the jupyter-book more extensively and work on interactive features.
