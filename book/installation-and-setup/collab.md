## Roles and responsibilities
To ensure smooth collaboration, it is essential to define the roles and responsibilities within your team. Firstly, designate who will be in charge of team organization ('administrators') who should be at least user type 4. Additionally, assign 'maintainers' responsible for combining content, also requiring at least user type 4. 'Editors' should be identified for editing and reviewing content, requiring at least user type 3.

Finally, ensure that team members identify themselves according to the user types. It is crucial to have at least one user type 4 or 5 on the team. While this role can be filled by a teaching assistant (TA), it is recommended that one of the teachers is also comfortable with this user type to provide adequate support and oversight.

## Review process
Furthermore, establish a clear editing and review process.

For the editing process, establish some practical rules on whether to use issues, branches and forks for adding content, fixing typos or making other changes. Furthermore, it can help to write down when you expect (draft) merge/pull requests and how to use the assign and review options in GitHub/GitLab. It is advisable to have at least a maintainer review each piece of content to maintain quality and consistency.

## Private, internally or public
Choose whether you want to share your source code and built book privately, internally or publicly. In any case, you need to obey copyright-rules. We advise public repositories and books in line with a vision on open education.

## Publishing via Open Interactive Textbooks TU Delft
Decide on whether or not to publish your book via Open Interactive Textbooks TU Delft. Publishing will give you a copyright check, ISBN or DOI number, and registration in several shared databases but limits the amount of changes you can make to your book: for substantial changes a new published version is needed with an updated copyright checks. Small changes like typos can always be made, which are processed in the published version every hour.
In case of editing a book for a course during that actual course and/or your book has limited value outside your course's content, we advise you only to publish an archived version of your book whenever the academic year is over.
