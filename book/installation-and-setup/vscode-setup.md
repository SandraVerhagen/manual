# VS Code

VS Code is a text editor with some extra features, such as integrated source control and a file browser. Moreover, extensions are available to add functionality to VS Code.

## Installation

VS Code can be downloaded from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com). The installation is fairly simple and won't be covered here.

## Extensions

These are some very useful extensions when working on Jupyter Books:

- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) - for obvious reasons. Also includes Jupyter Notebook rendering.
- [MyST-Markdown](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ExecutableBookProject.myst-highlight) - adds support for MyST markdown, including previews.
- [YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) - enables validation of `.yml` files (the format of the Jupyter Book configuration files).
