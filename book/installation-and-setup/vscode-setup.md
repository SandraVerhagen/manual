VS Code is a text editor with some extra features, such as integrated source control and a file browser. Moreover, extensions are available to add functionality to VS Code.

## Installation

VS Code can be downloaded from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com). The installation is fairly simple and won't be covered here.

## Extensions

When working with Jupyter Book (or Notebooks in general), these extensions are highly recommended:

- User type 4-6:
    - [MyST-Markdown](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ExecutableBookProject.myst-highlight) - adds support for MyST markdown, including previews.
    - [Spell checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) - Spelling checker for source code and text
- User type 5-6
    - [YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) - enables validation of `.yml` files (the format of the Jupyter Book configuration files).
    - [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) - for obvious reasons. Also includes Jupyter Notebook rendering.
    - [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) - Your AI pair progammer
