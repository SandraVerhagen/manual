A jupyter book is composed out of many files which contain the educational content produced by you. Through the use of branches it is possible to work on the book at the same time as your team-members. Working on content for the book is mainly individual work, the beauty of git comes in when everybody's changes are merged into the main branch.

We have previously introduced the notions of using Git in the online environment (remote) or locally. All the (text, figures, etc.) files that make up the book are contained on the remote repository on GitLab or GitHub. This could be on an open repository on `gitlab.com` or `github.com`. In the context of creating educational books for students at TU Delft, the repository will most likely be located on `gitlab.tudelft.nl` or `github.com/teachbooks`.

The steps involved are as follows:
 1. Assign task to yourself
 2. Create your own version of the book
 3. Edit the book by:
`````{tab-set}
````{tab-item} User type 3
- Add or make changes to a file
- Add changes to Git-timeline
````
````{tab-item} User type 4
- Eventually solve issues with combining versions
- Add or make changes to a file(s)
- Select files ready to be added to Git-timeline
- Add changes to Git-timeline
- Pushing your changes
````
````{tab-item} User type 5
- Eventually solve issues with combining versions
- Add or make changes to a file(s)
- Select files ready to be added to Git-timeline
- Check changes in book locally
- Add changes to Git-timeline
- If working on a repository locally: pushing your changes
````
`````
 4. Check changes online
 5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you're satisfied
 6. Reviewing, (eventually repeat steps 3 and 4) and combine your version with main draft version of book
 7. Publish changes to student version of the book
