# Collaborative book-editing using Git

As previously mentioned there are multiple platforms that can host Git repositories which are extremely useful for collaboration on text-based files. Here we will elaborate on two: GitLab and GitHub both in the online environment and locally on your device.

Globally, the steps involved are as follows:
 1. Define an issue to work on
 2. Open the files of the repository online or clone the repository to work on it locally
 3. Create a branch for your changes
 4. Edit the book by:
    - Pulling remote changes from others
    - Staging your changes
    - Committing a collection of changes
    - If working on a repository locally: pushing your changes
 5. Reviewing and merging changes in a merge request
 6. Publishing the changes to  the published version of the book
