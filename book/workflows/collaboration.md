A jupyter book is composed out of many files which contain the educational content produced by you. Through the use of branches it is possible to work on the book at the same time as your team-members. Working on content for the book is mainly individual work, the beauty of git comes in when everybody's changes are merged into the main branch.

We have previously introduced the notions of using Git in the online environment (remote) or locally. All the (text, figures, etc.) files that make up the book are contained on the remote repository on GitLab or GitHub. This could be on an open repository on `gitlab.com` or `github.com`. In the context of creating educational books for students at TU Delft, the repository will most likely be located on `gitlab.tudelft.nl` or `github.com/teachbooks`.

The steps involved are as follows:
 1. Assign task to yourself
 2. Open the files of the repository online or locally
 3. Create your own version of the book
 4. Edit the book by:
`````{tab-set}
````{tab-item} User type 3
- Make changes to your file
- Commit a changes
````
````{tab-item} User type 4
- Pulling remote changes from others
- Make changes to your file
- Saving / Staging your changes
- Commit a collection of changes
- Pushing your changes
````
````{tab-item} User type 5 and 6
- Pulling remote changes from others
- Make changes to your file
- Saving / Staging your changes
- Check changes locally
- Commit a collection of changes
- If working on a repository locally: pushing your changes
````
`````
 5. Check changes online
 6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you're satisfied
 7. Reviewing, (eventually repeat steps 4 and 5) and combine your version with main draft version of book
 8. Publish changes to student version of the book
