# Cloning a repository

Before we can start working on our Jupyter Book, we of course need to have the repository on our own system. This is done by *cloning* the repository, and here's how you do it with VS Code:

1. On GitLab, go to the repository of your book. Click on the blue button that says "Clone" ({numref}`gitlab-clone`), and copy the link under "Clone with SSH".

```{figure} ../images/gitlab-clone.png
:name: gitlab-clone

The cloning menu.
```

2. Open a new VS Code window. You should be greeted with a welcome page (see {numref})
