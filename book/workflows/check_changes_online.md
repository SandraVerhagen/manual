# Check changes online

Now that you've pushed your changes online, it's time to check the change in the online build book to make sure that your changes are processed correctly. For this step it is assumed you're using TeachBook's GitHub actions or TeachBook's GitLab pipeline.

At the moment this is not possible, but the workflow will soon be the same as for GitHub.
