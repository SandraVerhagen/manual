# Check changes online

Now that you've pushed your changes online, it's time to check the change in the online build book to make sure that your changes are processed correctly. For this step it is assumed you're using TeachBook's GitHub actions or TeachBook's GitLab pipeline.

````{tab-item} In GitLab
At the moment this is not possible, but the workflow will soon be the same as for GitHub.

````{tab-item} In GitHub
- Wait for the action to finish (GitHub Desktop shows progress if its part of a pull request, VS Code shows progress with the GitHub Actions addon)

You can keep on [editing](edit_book) and checking your changes until you're satisfied and ready for a review by a colleague.
