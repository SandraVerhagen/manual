# Working in Git

- what does the publish branch do?
- what is a pipeline

This coming page suggests a workflow how to collaborate using Git! Every team might have a different workflows but this workflow is shown as an example and is used in the MUDE course in CEG and by the TeachBooks team.<br>

There are two web-based platforms that host Git repositories: GitLab and GitHub. You might have read about GitHub Desktop that we are using to manage local repositories. GitLab and GitHub have similar features and are both widely used by the open source community. The main difference that is relevant for TeachBooks is that GitHub allows to host websites online without a server whereas GitLab needs a server. TU Delft has their own server which is why we use `tudelft.gitlab.nl`. 

Now that you understand how to collaborate in git it is time to get started on your own book. The end of this chapter provides a [tutorial](githubtemplate.md) on how to fork our template book. By forking you are essentially creating an independent copy of the template repository in your own GitLab or GitHub account.
