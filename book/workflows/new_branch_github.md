3. Finally, give your branch a name and specifiy the source branch. <br>

4. You will find your new branch in the drop down menu as seen on the figure below. You can then select your new branch and start working in it (new version) but you can also work in any other branch if you are helping out a colleague with their chapter for example (existing version).
