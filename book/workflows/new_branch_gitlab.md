1. Navigate to the repository of your project. Under the project description, you should see a menu button with a "+" in it. Click this button, then click on "New branch".

```{figure} ../images/gitlab-branch.png
 
Click the highlighted button to make a new branch.
```

2. A new page opens, on which you can specify the name of your branch and the source branch. Try to think of a good name for your branch. For example, `chapter-2` is a suitable name if we're going to be working on Chapter 2 of our book. After you've made sure that the selected source branch is correct, click "Create branch".

We're making a new branch called `chapter-2` from the `main` branch.
```

3. You should be sent back to an overview page of your repository. In the branch selection menu, it should now say `chapter-2` instead of `main`.

The circled menu is the branch selection menu.
