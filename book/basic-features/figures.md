# Figures 

To add a figure, just copy the figure to the correct directory. Then, in your markdown file, include the figure as follows:

    ```{figure} <figurename>.png/.jpg
    ---
    height/width: <height or width in pixels>
    name: <name of the figure>
    ---
    <Figure caption>
    ```

Or you can use the figure form below where you can specify all information and the code is produced for you:

<div id="figuur_formulier">

</div>
<div id="listContainer">
  
</div>
