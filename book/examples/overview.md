# Overview

This chapter will be all showcase some TeachBooks making great use of Jupyter Book and TeachBooks features. They can serve as an inspiring strting point for structuring your own TeachBook or just to get an idea of how other teachers are using it. 

extra:


includes examples for jupyter book pages with features. Here is an overview of the different examples:

- H5p: examples of H5p questions
- Combining theory with interactive questions
- Templates for interactive coding / non-coding elements:
    - Programming assignment: Example of how to convert a Jupyter notebook to Jupyter Book with live coding
    - Combining theory with interactive questions and extensive coding assignment: Example how to combine theory, quizzes and code on one page
    - Combining theory with interactive questions: Example how to combine theory with questions, so there's no coding involved.
    - Parametric question: Example for an equation to be checked on equivalence with the correct answer


Inspiring Examples to include:
- H5p quizes
    - Multiple choice (Question Set) -> MUDE Q1 Chapter 3 observation theory (3.1 Introduction)
    - Complex fill in the blanks -> MUDE Q1 Chapter 3 observation theory (3.7 Non-linear least squares estimation)
    - Dialog cards -> Optimization Chapter 1. Unconstrained Optimization (has a very interactive page with all h5p functions)
    - True/False Question -> MUDE Q2 Chapter 5 Optimization (5.4 Example Linear Programming)

- Sphinx Thebe rocket part 
    - Python for engineers Chapter 7 Matplotlib (Simple Code/which is what the browser python is for- heavy computations do the 'traditional' python) here might be a good section to add a note to clarify what is often asked during the teacher lunches
    - Look for a little bit harder code to show more complex computations are possible
        -> Possibly    MUDE Q2 Signal Processing (Square wave example)

- Interactive *hidden* code (this is not sphinx thebe?)
    -> MUDE Q2 Chapter 6 Machine learning (K-nearest neighbour)
    - interactive plot 
    - a whole set of questions that are based on the interactive plot + answers provided in tab


- Grasple?
- Videos? (too basic?)
- Elaborate on the templates?
