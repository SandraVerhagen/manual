# Overview

This chapter will showcase some TeachBooks making great use of Jupyter Book and TeachBooks features. They can serve as an inspiring starting point for structuring your own TeachBook or just to get an idea of how other teachers and students are using it. 

Here is an overview of the different examples:

- Clear book structure (keeping the content organized)
- Examples of H5p questions
- illustration of the Live Code (Rocket) feature
- Combination of heory and interactive questions
- Templates for interactive coding and non-coding elements

Julie:
- Sphinx Thebe rocket part 
    - Python for engineers Chapter 7 Matplotlib (Simple Code/which is what the browser python is for- heavy computations do the 'traditional' python) here might be a good section to add a note to clarify what is often asked during the teacher lunches
    - Look for a little bit harder code to show more complex computations are possible
        -> Possibly    MUDE Q2 Signal Processing (Square wave example)

- Interactive *hidden* code (this is not sphinx thebe?)
    -> MUDE Q2 Chapter 6 Machine learning (K-nearest neighbour)
    - interactive plot 
    - a whole set of questions that are based on the interactive plot + answers provided in tab
