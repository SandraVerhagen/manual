# Well-structured Overview

In this section some nice examples for ther overview of your book are covered. You might not judge a book by its cover but perhaps by its introduction:)

One thing students love is having all practical information about a course collected and updated on one page. <br>
No more scrolling through the introduction lecture on Brightspace while veryfing assessment methods on the online studyguide or finding out about the schedule on MyTimetable.

The crossover module Data Science and Artifical Intelligence for Engineers, or in short DSAIE, aims to teach powerful data science tools to 2nd master students from the Civil Engineering and Geosciences faculty. In order to do that they use a combination of practical projects and theory provided to the students through their online interactive [book](https://interactivetextbooks.citg.tudelft.nl/dsaie/intro.html). Let's have a look at it.

Additionally the book layout is explained to the students which can help clarify hot to use the interactive sections.

DSAIE Assessment methods + Tags
```
Logically, the assessment of the course are explained in a concise manner. Additionally, the lecturers have introduced some tags such as `written-exam` and `group-assignment`. Likewise, the reading material is also tagged with different sources so that student sknow where they can find more information.

Throughout the book, those tags might be used as follows:
